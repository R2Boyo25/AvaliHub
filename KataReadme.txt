before you say something about the jquery in the 404

i put it there because that jquery i dont plan on using again, the 404 page is an error page ur not supposed to see it. i just needed a jquery library and yes it looks disgusting, its kinda funny, no it doesnt work on mobile only on pc
all thats left really is just a profile page, a page to search/ show images and the backend scripts, thats all thats left!

ya know until theres more unforseen things lol


but aside from that its really close to being done, just need the backend of making accounts, posting, searching, marking tags etc then to reconfig one of my servers into  a web server and buy the domain then AvaliHub is online!

:D 

im really hyped for the final project!

also i hope you enjoy my 404 error page and my loading screen page!


(also yes i know the way i program is disgusting and looks horrible but thats just the way my brain thinks and i understand those files better for some reason when they are written like that)
